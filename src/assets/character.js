Her friends jokingly call her Marinette, or Lady Bug. Sometimes Mary can get melancholy, most often during rainy weather.  In this state she likes to cover herself with a blanket and under a cup of tea to watch movies or read her favorite adventure and fantasy books, as well as she can shout or offend a person, but immediately tries to apologize. But in such a state she spends not long as her HUGE amount puts everything in its place. As a child she studied in an international school, where she communicated with people from different countries and because of this she can start to speak a completely different language, for which she apologizes very much. But like all people, Mary has a flip side, she is a hacker who uses her skills for blogging. Because of her other side and the huge amount of energy she often gets into all sorts of trouble, but she does not stop it, she even likes it, because at such times she feels like a character of her favorite adventure books. Mary loves to talk about her adventures. She also has a fear of fires and loneliness, and because of her energy it sometimes seems that the flow of her words cannot be stopped.
